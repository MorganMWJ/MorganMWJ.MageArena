2D top-down arena spellcaster battle game
cartoon like

Gain levels through xp => points to choose spells, extar health, 
gain xp through summary of arean/level completetion (number of kills, damage taken, etc...)

gear could be rewards for special achievements/boss kills/drops
gear can grant very special unique powers
certain gear - Staff, Robe, Head Piece, ?Ring?
Different gear gives very different look and feel


Different arena like levels - different map & enemies
Can still play level 1 with high level character (for fun little reward)
Challenges with rewards???




SPELLS:
teleport
sheild
fireball
conjure vortex
summon golem
invisble
Paralyse enemy
Tie up enemy in plant vines
Silence (mute mages)
Mastering a spell changes it's effect and makes it cheaper (or free) to cast

Enemies:
 zombie/mobs, soldiers (different armor levels)
 large enemies - troll, demon
 spell caster enemies - wizard (neophyte, acolyte, arch mage)

Melee enemies should attack quickly (no warning sheild blocks only if it would actually block attack) and be weak compared to player - but there are many of them
Player should be able to cast a lot of spells quickly - dependant on magic bar
Spell casting enemies should cast spells slowly (only player can cast as quickly as they can react)
